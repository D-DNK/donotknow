# A man of many faces
This is a list of Chris's pseudonyms, organisations, and communities/websites. Obviously, more get added all the time, and I'll try to keep myself updated with what's going on. No promises though.

 2. Milo Chapman
 3. Harris Hamilton
 4. Nate Watts
 5. Edwin Baker
 6. Rory Gallagher

 8. Cassius Woods
 9. Casper Green

## Common Sites
[Do Not Know](https://donotknow.tk/ "The Internet Secret") - The Internet Secret
[42745](https://42745.tk/ "Deeper Discussion") - Deeper Discussion
[Deep Discussion](http://u2dobfdtdejffzsira23teluvijaubs3dpdmtihkwvkpekxuvmtss7id.onion/index.php "Deep Discussion (TOR Hidden Service)") - TOR Hidden Service

# Contact

There are a million option if you want Chris. I have been doing my research and I have concluded that this is a concise list of options. If you find out another way to talk to Chris, you can let me know on his site: [DNK](https://donotknow.tk/ "The Internet Secret")

## Email

- Email is by far the largest method of communication worldwide, and as such, Chris has made it easy to contact him using this method.
    > For a **complete list** of addresses to email Chris, check his site: [DNK](https://donotknow.tk/ "The Internet Secret"), although I should have them all here.

- Chris kindly asks that you do not email him stupidly. He's a man who appreciates privacy, as I'm sure you are, and he would appreciate if you contacted him by a secure email service with proper privacy measures taken.

**NOTE: Clearnet users may email any of the email addresses, including the _Anonymous/TOR Addresses_, but TOR accounts should only email the first six listed.**

Ok, so here's the list. The DEFAULT ones are ones he prefers to use, but as far as I am aware he checks them all now and then.
### Anonymous/TOR Addresses:

>[4d343e13-0b2b-46aa-a76b-f5da2d3c4404@anonaddy.me](mailto:4d343e13-0b2b-46aa-a76b-f5da2d3c4404@anonaddy.me) (DEFAULT)

>[9ec974b8-1928-4c55-ad83-b95c9a159d06@anonaddy.me](mailto:9ec974b8-1928-4c55-ad83-b95c9a159d06@anonaddy.me) (DEFAULT)

### Clearnet/OpenIdentity Addresses:
>[42745@tuta.io](mailto:42745@tuta.io) (DEFAULT)
>[cyberfact@pm.me](mailto:cyberfact@pm.me) (DEFAULT)

>[donotknow@null.net](mailto:donotknow@null.net)

## Other Platforms
Obviously, communication isn't limited to email. You can communicate with Chris via his website \[[DNK](https://donotknow.tk "The Internet Secret")\]

### Tox

If you have qtox or utox, great! Chris is available for communication there.

>991A7E0F4E1504E21E0F2DAA988539AD3E89D3AB6F1E6901C6F094E8844B6723488CC131EC9F

Please use responsibly. **Never text using Antidote** or another mobile client for Tox. It is not safe.

### IRC
Chris has a few IRC Channels that he looks at frequently. He owns all of them, and welcomes you to look around.

>Matrix - Using Riot IM
>>>Chanel: `donotknow:matrix.org`
>>>Community: `+nullnet:matrix.org`
>
>Freenode - Any IRC Client
>>`#donotknow.tk`
>>`#42745`
>>`#thenullnetwork`
>>`#cosilence`
>
>OFTC- Any IRC Client
>>`#donotknow.tk`
>>`#42745`
>>`#thenullnetwork`
>>`#null.net`
>>`#cosilence`

Ok, almost there. If email, Tox and IRC aren't enough for you, there's still more. You can contact him on any three of his sites mentioned above under the *Common Sites* heading.

### Telegram
Chris also uses Telegram. He is available at the username <code>@CYB3RFACT</code>.</p>

In general - try to follow the structure below when contacting Chris, trying the first thing first and the last thing last.
```mermaid
graph TB
A(<p>Email Chris Using a Tor Configured Email Service</p>)
A --> B(<p>Tox him</p>)
B --> C(<p>Email him Using a Standard Email Address</p>)
B --> D(<p>Connect with him via IRC</p>)
C --> E(<p>Telegram him</p>)
D --> E
E --> F(<p>Use on of his common websites</p>)
```
Try not to use the last one - LEA can easily pick up your message. Use the TOR hidden service one if you need to contact Chris that way - although sometimes it will be down.

### Gitter
[![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/thenullnetwork/donotknow.svg)](https://gitter.im/thenullnetwork/donotknow?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge)

Click the button above. It's simple way to talk to Chris via the Gitter chat platform @ [The Null Network/donotknow](https://gitter.im/thenullnetwork/donotknow?utm_source=share-link&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=share-link) channel.

I take my job of being an information file very seriously. **But please _don't be stupid_!**

# Important things to note:

Looking to learn a little bit about the man? There's a lot to him. He can be found at pretty much any corner of the internet. He is an active Clearnet (or Surfacenet for you hardcore computer scientists), Tor, and Freenet user. He works hard on balancing his computer life with his real one. He loves making new friends, both online and in real life, and participates in a staggeringly wide range of activities. Tennis, chess, parkour, he does it all. He uses his keen eye to brighten up the world with his photography and occasionally writes screenplays, novels, and poetry. Here are some important facts about Chris though.



## Chris is not a paedophile

Chris explores the ins and outs of the internet, and as part of the exploration, he comes across sites that facilitate child pornography. There are forums, group chats, and various other mediums where child abuse content can be found.

Chris in no way supports anything that hurts or exploits children.

## Chris is not a criminal
Chris tries to stay as legal as possible. He doesn't participate in the trafficking of money, drugs, weapons, humans or children. He doesn't even support them. He's just smart enough to know that he can't stop them. He doesn't support anything illegal, he's just too lazy to do anything about it.

## Chris can help
If you need help with anything that doesn't require money, Chris wants to help. If you're lonely, attracted to animals, only four foot tall, and you want to talk about your issues, Chris is happy to help. If you need relationship advice, accidentally killed a guy, or grieving the death of a recent loss, Chris is the go-to guy. If you do talk to him, don't get Chris involved in anything that could hurt him or violate his safety otherwise. He has a good thing going.

Similarly, if you have committed a crime, and you need help, Chris will hear you out. He can try to help you find a solution to whatever problem you may have, or help you rectify the situation and make thing right. If you have committed a serious crime (i.e. a crime against the human (murder, rape, assault), Chris will have to consider his legal responsibilities as well. **Don't ever** give identifiable information to Chris unless you have some planned course of action.

# The end
This is all I can help you with now. I hope I was informative enough. Bye. :)
