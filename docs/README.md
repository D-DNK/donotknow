## What is [DNK](https://donotknow.tk)?
DNK is a web-project designed to make the web more accessible to everyone, while respecting their privacy and financial restrictions. Every thing that DNK provides is **FREE** and allows for **complete anonymity**, although you do need to smart about that yourself. DNK can be self-hosted for added privacy, and it's package gets larger every day. (Or week, or month).

## Specs:
 - Complete anonymity (when used right)
 - Tor Friendly
 - Self-hostable
 - Open-source
 - 100% Free
 - All are easy to install and setup

### Can I get support with setting up?
Yes you can! There is never any problem when it comes to supporting you guys. We are always happy to help. Most of it should be easy enough to install and configure, but of course some of it can be hard. To get support - go to [DNK//Chat](https://donotknow.tk/chat/) and send a direct message to @DNK. If you cannot figure out how to do that, just type `@DNK` into the post box followed by your question, and remember to include a way to contact you. Email perferably. 

## Background:
So what we have are three things. DNK, TNN and COS.

### DNK (Do Not Know)
DNK is the parent of it all. The DNK community hosts all the other two, and welcomes everyone into it. DNK is focused on accessibility and freedom. It's that simple. You are welcome to contact DNK, Nemo, or Nomad @ [the chat](https://donotknow.tk/chat/) if you have any questions at all regarding yourself and the internet.

### TNN (The Null Network)
The Null Network is a small network of users of DNK dedicated to moderating and building it. The Null Network currently consists of @DNK @Nemo @Nomad @JMax @arco @tonc @ATOM. These users are helped by Senior Members, currently @TILTER @simone @Anton @CtrlAltDel.

### COS (Company of Silence)
The Company of Silence means literally nothing. It just represents the admins (DNK | Nemo | Nomad), and is also the name of our 'extranet' project... read [COS.md](cos.md) for more inforation. (:
